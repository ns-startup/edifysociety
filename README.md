# EdifySociety - EVERY INDIVIDUAL HAS SOMETHING TO TEACH AND SOMETHING TO LEARN
https://www.edifysociety.com

Concept:
OBJECTIVE:
Creating self-sufficient multi-talented society through shared learning of skills beyond traditional academia.
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:

A peer to peer e-learning platform primarily focused on teaching non-subjective skills to students and people in other walks of life to help them become well-rounded individuals both personally and professionally. People exploring the platform can not only learn additional skills but also teach their area of expertise earning a supplemental income regardless of their position in the society.
Even though there are a lot of online sources available to gain information most of them being offline does not instill the same level of enthusiasm as interactive learning. While a number of platforms are dedicated to classroom learning, there is a gap that exists for non-academic interactive knowledge sharing online. Our service addresses the above-mentioned market need with the creation of a seamless live streaming platform experience that positions itself as the prospective 'First to Market' leader in supplemental e-learning platform focused on community development in India. With increased users of online media, the service is tailored simplistically so that people across rural areas can access it without any obstacles.

PURPOSE:

Our platform not only strives to cater to the need of learning additional skills but also operates on the core concept that "Every individual has something to teach and something to learn". While people are generally reluctant to step out of their comfort zone, invoking their interest by providing unique subjects to learn at competitive prices taught by people of their choosing offers them the additional motivation to come out of their shell and etching towards self-development.

DIFFERENTIATION:

Adopting a no-hindrance initiation process with no sign-up fee or membership fee and also charging minimum commissions will place our platform in a different light. But the main differentiator will be the aspect of community learning as we not only recommend individual learning but also steadfastly support group learning of members in a community and also encourage a lot of teachers in our community to offer free live streaming classes. This allows anyone in the community even the less privileged people to get access to top quality content at very minimal price. By encouraging people to not only learn but also teach their proficiency makes every individual a valuable contributing member of the society. Also focusing on homemakers and retirees as our teaching base gives us access to high quality content from a section of the population that is usually overlooked.

VALUE PROPOSITION:

The service besides functioning as a medium for learning could also serve as a stage for people to express their talent and receive valid recognition and feedback. Young adults are not the singular target audience of the app as even professionals can use it to update their skills or learn an activity they always wanted to but never could. Every skill taught in the platform is not focused on just obtaining knowledge
for monetary purposes but with the intention of inculcating and invigorating passion in different fields in the minds of people.
Intrinsic areas such as Culture will be given the deserved importance allowing people from varying parts of the world to learn about different cultures, rituals as deep practical insights into the different cultural aspects are largely unavailable. The platform focuses on bringing out the charitable quality in everyone such that people will be coming forward to teach and share their knowledge to orphanages and to communities with less learning opportunities as everyone has the chance to acquire knowledge regardless of their social or economic situation.
Primarily kids can use this platform to find out their passion/Interest in a range of skills and figure out their future areas of Interest and gain valuable guidance in the chosen area.

FUTURE PROSPECTS:

With the advent of cost-effective VR (Virtual Reality) devices, VR and AR (Augmented Reality) learning could be integrated with the service resulting in an immersive learning experience. The platform potentially could host live performances and concerts where people can raise money. Cultural tourism through paid VR guided tours that will earn local's additional revenue with the use of seamless VR conversion software embedded in our service. Possessing a target population of more than a billion, the captured People’s interest data could be used as input for setting up a Skill repository that can potentially predict future business strategies based on changing customer interests. Most significantly creating a system of knowledge sharing and people development where every citizen's contribution is valued and in turn helps India as a whole to become a self-sufficient standalone hub for Digital empowerment and innovation.
